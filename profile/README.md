# Keeta 

## Who we are
Today’s global payments system is like a highway with tolls every two miles. Long waits and extra fees are inherent to this legacy system. We cut out the unnecessary middlemen and ensure your payment is sent using the most efficient routing.

That’s why Keeta works with governments and banks to create a safer path for your money without any stops.
